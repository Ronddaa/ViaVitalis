    "title": "About Us",
    "abouttext1": "In sunny Italy, in the Tuscany region, among the hills of Casentino, at 500m above sea level – lies our Lavender and Rosemary plantation. From these plants, using steam distillation, we obtain essential oils of the highest quality! This is not industrial mass production, but artisanal work, caring for each individual plant.",
    "abouttext2": "Our plantation is based on: craftsmanship, ancient knowledge of nature, plants, planetary energies – and their connection with the human body and influence upon it.",
    "abouttext3": "The most important aspect of the high quality of our essential oils is that the plantation was planted and cultivated according to the natural cycle of the Moon and astrological calculations. Harvesting was carried out at precise hours of the full moon, when plants reach the “peak” of their therapeutic properties, influencing the interaction between the energies of nature and humans, product concentration, and its quality.",
    "abouttext4": "When choosing a product, it is important to understand its origin and quality, on which the result depends. The varieties found in many pharmacies and shops – often come from low-quality oils, diluted with fillers or fragrances, or synthetically reproduced in laboratories.",
    "textCircle": "This is done to lower the price. 100% natural essential oils of the highest quality – are expensive! The price depends on the harvest, weather conditions, harvesting, and other factors.",
